// THE LOCKED DOOR


// Aboard the starship Awkward Mathematics, you find yourself confronted by a locked door with a numerical keypad, 
// into which the passcode must be entered.

// However, in keeping with the ship's slightly convoluted engineering practices, it has a couple of stipulations which, 
// once known, may actually be considered something of a security oversight...


// The door's requirements are as follows:

// To input the code into the door, it must be first expressed via a function, which takes in two integer inputs 
// and mutiplies them together, to produce the code itself.

// The resulting code must have TWO digits (no more, no fewer).
// The code MUST be a perfect square number. (Although the arguments do not both have to be the same number)



//Please run npm install to begin...
export function perfectPassCode(num1, num2) {
  //Your code here
}
